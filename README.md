This is a Disassembler I wrote in the summer between grade 11 and grade 12


Adhesive Disassembler Readme:

What?
    Adhesive disassembler is a limited disassembler engine written by AdhesiveBall.
    It was made because the author wants to learn more about the x86 instruction set and because he wanted to do something cool before school started.
    It's usage is simple, simply call parse_instruction() to disassemble and build_string() to find the representation as a string.

Stuff:
    A lot of the code in this version (0.0.3) was written with the "good enough" philosophy in mind.
    Not that I believe in this philosophy, but this was really the first time that I've been working against a deadline (start of school)
    and I wanted to get it done.

    Hopefully the later versions will be a lot more elegant and smaller.

    If nothing else, I had a lot of fun writing this and I learned a lot.
